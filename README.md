- ### Advanced Predictive Modeling Term Paper

	- [Kaggle Competition_Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Rwoot14/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Kaggle%20Competition_Churn%20Prediction%20): A Kaggle competition which doubled as a term: [Paper](https://github.com/Rwoot14/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Kaggle%20Competition_Churn%20Prediction%20/paper.pdf), churn is an ongoing problem in many industries and this term paper focuses on churn prediction for a popular music streaming service in Asia. 

- ### Python Projects

	- [AirBnB Project](https://github.com/Rwoot14/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/AirBnB%20Project/AirBnB%20Project.ipynb): A Natural Language Processing project which examined the sentiment and cosine simularity of renters reviews. The [presentation](https://github.com/91jackcheng/Text-Analytics/blob/master/Project/Project%20presentation.pdf) provides a synopsis of the results and our process.
  
  - [KickStarter Project](https://github.com/Rwoot14/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/KickStarter%20Project/KickStarter%20Project.ipynb): This project had two objectives: to find the attributes of a kickstarter which made it successful and predicting the likelihood of a project being successfully funded given its attributes. The [Presentation](https://github.com/Rwoot14/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/KickStarter%20Project/Project%20slides.pdf) is a useful overview of the project with a more detailed EDA section and the [Paper](https://github.com/Rwoot14/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/KickStarter%20Project/Pattern%20Analysis%20of%20Kickstarter%20Projects.pdf) is a more detailed description of the projects process and results.
  
  - [Yelp Project](https://github.com/Rwoot14/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/KickStarter%20Project): Understanding consumer preferences can be a very powerful tool for local businesses. This project focused on Las Vegas businesses and their attributes which consumers liked and disliked on Yelp. Businesses could use this information to further their presence in Las Vegas and increase their Yelp rating.
